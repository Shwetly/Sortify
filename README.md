📊 Sortify – Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sortify is an interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using animated vertical bars whose heights represent array values.

This project is designed to help students and beginners understand sorting algorithms intuitively through real-time animations.

✨ Features

🎯 Visual representation using dynamic bars

⚡ Adjustable sorting speed

📏 Adjustable array size

🔄 Generate random arrays

🧠 Multiple sorting algorithms

🎨 Color-coded steps for better understanding:

Current element

Visited elements

Minimum element

Sorted elements

🧮 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Each algorithm is animated step-by-step to clearly show comparisons and swaps.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling & animations

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic & visualization

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

🎨 Color Legend (Visualization States)
Color	Meaning
Gray	Unsorted bar
Blue	Currently visited
Teal	Current comparison
Pink	Minimum element
Green	Sorted element
